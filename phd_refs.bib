	the healthy human oral cavity, including not-yet-cultivated bacteria
	species, and (ii) to determine the site and subject specificity of

	were analyzed. Sites included tongue dorsum, lateral sides of tongue,
	buccal epithelium, hard palate, soft palate, supragingival plaque
	of tooth surfaces, subgingival plaque, maxillary anterior vestibule,
	and tonsils. 16S rRNA genes from sample DNA were amplified, cloned,
	and transformed into Escherichia coli. Sequences of 16S rRNA genes
	were used to determine species identity or closest relatives. In
	2,589 clones, 141 predominant species were detected, of which over
	60\% have not been cultivated. Thirteen new phylotypes were identified.
	Species common to all sites belonged to the genera Gemella, Granulicatella,
	Streptococcus, and Veillonella. While some species were subject specific
	and detected in most sites, other species were site specific. Most
	sites possessed 20 to 30 different predominant species, and the number
	of predominant species from all nine sites per individual ranged
	from 34 to 72. Species typically associated with periodontitis and
	caries were not detected. There is a distinctive predominant bacterial
	flora of the healthy oral cavity that is highly diverse and site

	has long been regarded as a model for that of the mitochondrion,
	with which there are many components (e.g., cytochrome aa3 oxidase)
	in common. Members of the genus exhibit a great range of metabolic
	flexibility, particularly with respect to processes involving respiration.
	Prominent examples of flexibility are the use in denitrification
	of nitrate, nitrite, nitrous oxide, and nitric oxide as alternative
	electron acceptors to oxygen and the ability to use C1 compounds
	(e.g., methanol and methylamine) as electron donors to the respiratory

	not constitutive, and the underlying complex regulatory systems that
	regulate their expression are beginning to be unraveled. There has
	been uncertainty about whether transcription in a member of the alpha-3
	Proteobacteria such as P. denitrificans involves a conventional sigma70-type
	RNA polymerase, especially since canonical -35 and -10 DNA binding
	sites have not been readily identified. In this review, we argue
	that many genes, in particular those encoding constitutive proteins,
	may be under the control of a sigma70 RNA polymerase very closely
	related to that of Rhodobacter capsulatus. While the main focus is
	on the structure and regulation of genes coding for products involved
	in respiratory processes in Paracoccus, the current state of knowledge

	problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed
	in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution
	of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated
	without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting
	a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated
	summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics
	into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages
	of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency
	of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method
	is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out
	in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters
	that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without
	difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical
	efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods
	previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative
	efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary
	statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

	kb of DNA was involved in the recombination, including the entire
	capsule gene cluster. The oatWY gene carried by the W:2a:P1.7-2,4
	strain contained the insertion sequence element IS1301, one of five
	variants of oatWY found in group W135 strains belonging to the carriage-associated
	ST-22 clonal complex. This suggested that the origin of the capsule
	genes carried by the invasive W:2a:P1.7-2,4 strain is carriage associated.
	These results provide novel evidence for the long-standing dogma
	that disease-associated strains acquire antigenic structure from
	carriage-associated strains. Moreover, the capsule switch described
	here has arisen from the exchange of the entire capsule locus.},

  abstract = {The modified Q cycle mechanism accounts for the proton and charge
	translocation stoichiometry of the bc(1) complex, and is now widely
	accepted. However the mechanism by which the requisite bifurcation
	of electron flow at the Q(o) site reaction is enforced is not clear.
	One of several proposals involves conformational gating of the docking
	of the Rieske ISP at the Q(o) site, controlled by the stage of the
	reaction cycle. Effects of different Q(o)-site inhibitors on the
	position of the ISP seen in crystals may reflect the same conformational
	mechanism, in which case understanding how different inhibitors control
	the position of the ISP may be a key to understanding the enforcement
	of bifurcation at the Q(o) site (TableÂ 1). Here we examine the available
	structures of cytochrome bc(1) with different Q(o)-site inhibitors
	and different ISP positions to look for clues to this mechanism.
	The effect of ISP removal on binding affinity of the inhibitors stigmatellin
	and famoxadone suggest a "mutual stabilization" of inhibitor binding
	and ISP docking, however this thermodynamic observation sheds little
	light on the mechanism. The cd(1) helix of cytochrome b moves in
	such a way as to accommodate docking when inhibitors favoring docking
	are bound, but it is impossible with the current structures to say
	whether this movement of Î±-cd(1) is a cause or result of ISP docking.
	One component of the movement of the linker between E and F helices
	also correlates with the type of inhibitor and ISP position, and
	seems to be related to the H-bonding pattern of Y279 of cytochrome
	b. An H-bond from Y279 to the ISP, and its possible modulation by
	movement of F275 in the presence of famoxadone and related inhibitors,
	or its competition with an alternate H-bond to I269 of cytochrome
	b that may be destabilized by bound famoxadone, suggest other possible

  abstract = {Molecular data on a limited number of chromosomal loci have shown
	that the population of Neisseria meningitidis (Nm), a deadly human
	pathogen, is structured in distinct lineages. Given that the Nm population
	undergoes substantial recombination, the mechanisms resulting in
	the evolution of these lineages, their persistence in time, and the
	implications for the pathogenicity of the bacterium are not yet completely
	understood. Based on whole-genome sequencing, we show that Nm is
	structured in phylogenetic clades. Through acquisition of specific
	genes and through insertions and rearrangements, each clade has acquired
	and remodeled specific genomic tracts, with the potential to impact
	on the commensal and virulence behavior of Nm. Despite this clear
	evidence of a structured population, we confirm high rates of detectable
	recombination throughout the whole Nm chromosome. However, gene conversion
	events were found to be longer within clades than between clades,
	suggesting a DNA cleavage mechanism associated with the phylogeny
	of the species. We identify 22 restriction modification systems,
	probably acquired by horizontal gene transfer from outside of the
	species/genus, whose distribution in the different strains coincides
	with the phylogenetic clade structure. We provide evidence that these
	clade-associated restriction modification systems generate a differential
	barrier to DNA exchange consistent with the observed population structure.
	These findings have general implications for the emergence of lineage
	structure and virulence in recombining bacterial populations, and
	they could provide an evolutionary framework for the population biology
	of a number of other bacterial species that show contradictory population
	structure and dynamics.},

	shown to be products of the mitochondrial genome, and 35 nuclear
	encoded subunits were identified. The complex is L-shaped with one
	arm in the plane of the membrane and the other lying orthogonal to
	it in the mitochondrial matrix. With mildly chaotropic detergents,
	the intact complex has been resolved into various subcomplexes. Subcomplex
	Ilambda represents the extrinsic arm, subcomplex Ialpha consists
	of subcomplex Ilambda plus part of the membrane arm, and subcomplex
	Ibeta is another substantial part of the membrane arm. The intact
	complex and these three subcomplexes have been subjected to extensive
	reanalysis. Their subunits have been separated by three independent
	methods (one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-PAGE,
	and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)) and
	analyzed by tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting and tandem mass spectrometry.
	The masses of many of the intact subunits have also been measured
	by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and have provided valuable
	information about post-translational modifications. The presence
	of the known 35 nuclear encoded subunits in complex I has been confirmed,
	and four additional nuclear encoded subunits have been detected.
	Subunits B16.6, B14.7, and ESSS were discovered in the SDS-PAGE analysis
	of subcomplex Ilambda, in the two-dimensional gel analysis of the
	intact complex, and in the HPLC analysis of subcomplex Ibeta, respectively.
	Despite many attempts, no sequence information has been obtained
	yet on a fourth new subunit (mass 10,566+/-2 Da) also detected in
	the HPLC analysis of subcomplex Ibeta. It is unlikely that any more
	subunits of the bovine complex remain undiscovered. Therefore, the
	intact enzyme is a complex of 46 subunits, and, assuming there is
	one copy of each subunit in the complex, its mass is 980 kDa.},

	of cytochrome c(4) does not exhibit saturation. Global spectroscopic
	analysis of the time course of the oxidation of cytochrome c(4) indicates
	that the apparent lack of saturation is due to the strong dependence
	of K(M) and V(max) on the concentration of oxidized cytochrome c(4).
	Whether this is an artifact of the in vitro assay or has physiological
	significance remains unknown. Cyclic voltammetry was used to determine
	that the midpoint potentials of the two hemes in cytochrome c(4)
	are 240 and 340 mV (vs standard hydrogen electrode), similar to the
	electrochemical properties of other c(4)-type cytochromes. Genomic
	analysis shows a strong correlation between the presence of a c(4)-type
	cytochrome and a cbb(3) oxygen reductase within the beta- and gamma-proteobacterial
	clades, suggesting that cytochrome c(4) is the likely natural electron
	donor to the cbb(3) oxygen reductases within these organisms. These
	would include the beta-proteobacteria Neisseria meningitidis and
	Neisseria gonnorhoeae, in which the cbb(3) oxygen reductases are
	the only terminal oxidases in their respiratory chains, and the gamma-proteobacterium
	Pseudomonas stutzeri.},

	activated by FNR, and a further 28 operons appeared to be repressed.
	For each of these operons, a match to the consensus FNR-binding site

	Qi-site, and is the reaction limiting turnover. (ii) Activation energies
	for transient processes to which movement of the ISP must contribute
	are much lower than that of the rate-limiting step. (iii) Comparison
	of experimental data with a simple mathematical model demonstrates
	that the kinetics of reduction of cytochromes c1 and bH are fully
	explained by the modified Q-cycle. (iv) All rates for processes associated
	with movement of the ISP are more rapid by at least an order of magnitude
	than the rate of ubiquinol oxidation. (v) Movement of the ISP head
	does not introduce a significant delay in reduction of the high potential
	chain by quinol, and it is not necessary to invoke such a delay to
	explain the kinetic disparity between the kinetics of reduction of
	cytochromes c1 and bH.},

	nasopharyngeal mucosa. Depending on age, climate, country, socioeconomic
	status, and other factors, approximately 10\% of the human population
	harbors meningococci in the nose. However, invasive disease is relatively
	rare, as it occurs only when the following conditions are fulfilled:
	(i) contact with a virulent strain, (ii) colonization by that strain,
	(iii) penetration of the bacterium through the mucosa, and (iv) survival
	and eventually outgrowth of the meningococcus in the bloodstream.
	When the meningococcus has reached the bloodstream and specific antibodies
	are absent, as is the case for young children or after introduction
	of a new strain in a population, the ultimate outgrowth depends on
	the efficacy of the innate immune response. Massive outgrowth leads
	within 12 h to fulminant meningococcal sepsis (FMS), characterized
	by high intravascular concentrations of endotoxin that set free high
	concentrations of proinflammatory mediators. These mediators belonging
	to the complement system, the contact system, the fibrinolytic system,
	and the cytokine system induce shock and diffuse intravascular coagulation.
	FMS can be fatal within 24 h, often before signs of meningitis have
	developed. In spite of the increasing possibilities for treatment
	in intensive care units, the mortality rate of FMS is still 30\%.
	When the outgrowth of meningococci in the bloodstream is impeded,
	seeding of bacteria in the subarachnoidal compartment may lead to
	overt meningitis within 24 to 36 h. With appropriate antibiotics
	and good clinical surveillance, the mortality rate of this form of
	invasive disease is 1 to 2\%. The overall mortality rate of meningococcal
	disease can only be reduced when patients without meningitis, i.e.,
	those who may develop FMS, are recognized early. This means that
	the fundamental nature of the disease as a meningococcus septicemia
	deserves more attention.},

	cluster, which breaks down in the presence of oxygen to a 2Fe-2S
	cluster and subsequently to apo-FNR. The kinetics of NmFNR cluster
	disassembly in the presence of oxygen are 2Ã¢ÂÂ3ÃÂ slower than those
	previously reported for wild-type EcFNR, but similar to constitutively

	M. J., Read, R. C., and Moir, J. W. (2007) J. Bacteriol. 189, 1138Ã¢ÂÂ1144).
	NmFNR binds to DNA containing a consensus FNR box sequence, and this
	binding stabilizes the iron-sulfur cluster in the presence of oxygen.
	Partial degradation of the 4Fe-4S cluster to a 3Fe-4S occurs, and
	this form remains bound to the DNA. The 3Fe-4S cluster is converted

	by host innate immunity. Here we show that the utilization of carbon
	sources by N. meningitidis determines its ability to withstand complement-mediated
	lysis, through the intimate relationship between metabolism and virulence
	in the bacterium. The gene encoding the lactate permease, lctP, was
	identified and disrupted. The lctP mutant had a reduced growth rate
	in cerebrospinal fluid compared with the wild type, and was attenuated
	during bloodstream infection through loss of resistance against complement-mediated
	killing. The link between lactate and complement was demonstrated
	by the restoration of virulence of the lctP mutant in complement
	(C3(-/-))-deficient animals. The underlying mechanism for attenuation
	is mediated through the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway, which is
	directly connected to central carbon metabolism. The findings highlight
	the intimate relationship between bacterial physiology and resistance
	to innate immune killing in the meningococcus.},

  abstract = {In Impedance Microbiology, the time during which the measuring equipment
	is connected to the bipolar cells is rather long, usually between
	6 to 24 hrs for microorganisms with duplication times in the order
	of less than one hour and concentrations ranging from 10(1) to 10(7)
	[CFU/ml]. Under these conditions, the electrode-electrolyte interface
	impedance may show a slow drift of about 2\%/hr. By and large, growth
	curves superimposed on such drift do not stabilize, are less reproducible,
	and keep on distorting all over the measurement of the temporal reactive
	or resistive records due to interface changes, in turn originated
	in bacterial activity. This problem has been found when growth curves
	were obtained by means of impedance analyzers or with impedance bridges
	using different types of operational amplifiers.Suspecting that the
	input circuitry was the culprit of the deleterious effect, we used
	for that matter (a) ultra-low bias current amplifiers, (b) isolating
	relays for the selection of cells, and (c) a shorter connection time,
	so that the relays were maintained opened after the readings, to
	bring down such spurious drift to a negligible value. Bacterial growth
	curves were obtained in order to test their quality.It was demonstrated
	that the drift decreases ten fold when the circuit remained connected
	to the cell for a short time between measurements, so that the distortion
	became truly negligible. Improvement due to better-input amplifiers
	was not as good as by reducing the connection time. Moreover, temperature
	effects were insignificant with a regulation of +/- 0.2 [ degrees
	C]. Frequency did not influence either.The drift originated either
	at the dc input bias offset current (Ios) of the integrated circuits,
	or in discrete transistors connected directly to the electrodes immersed
	in the cells, depending on the particular circuit arrangement. Reduction
	of the connection time was the best countermeasure.},

	Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The norB gene product shares significant identity
	with the nitric oxide reductases in Ralstonia eutropha and Synechocystis
	sp. and, like those organisms, the gonococcus lacks a norC homolog.
	The gonococcal norB gene was found to be required for anaerobic growth,
	but the absence of norB did not dramatically decrease anaerobic survival.
	In a wild-type background, induction of norB expression was seen
	anaerobically in the presence of nitrite but not anaerobically without
	nitrite or aerobically. norB expression is not regulated by FNR or
	NarP, but a functional aniA gene (which encodes an anaerobically
	induced outer membrane nitrite reductase) is necessary for expression.
	When aniA is constitutively expressed, norB expression can be induced
	both anaerobically and aerobically, but only in the presence of nitrite,
	suggesting that nitric oxide, which is likely to be produced by AniA
	as a product of nitrite reduction, is the inducing agent. This was
	confirmed with the use of the nitric oxide donor, spermine-nitric
	oxide complex, in an aniA null background both anaerobically and
	aerobically. NorB is important for gonococcal adaptation to an anaerobic
	environment, a physiologically relevant state during gonococcal infection.
	The presence of this enzyme, which is induced by nitric oxide, may
	also have implications in immune evasion and immunomodulation in
	the human host.},

  abstract = {Heme-copper oxidases (HCuOs) are the terminal components of the respiratory
	chain in the mitochondrial membrane or the cell membrane in many
	bacteria. These enzymes reduce oxygen to water and use the free energy
	from this reaction to maintain a proton-motive force across the membrane
	in which they are embedded. The heme-copper oxidases of the cbb3-type
	are only found in bacteria, often pathogenic ones since they have
	a low Km for O2, enabling the bacteria to colonize semi-anoxic environments.
	Cbb3-type (C) oxidases are highly divergent from the mitochondrial-like
	aa3-type (A) oxidases, and within the heme-copper oxidase family,
	cbb3 is the closest relative to the most divergent member, the bacterial
	nitric oxide reductase (NOR). Nitric oxide reductases reduce NO to
	N2O without coupling the reaction to the generation of any electrochemical
	proton gradient. The significant structural differences between A-
	and C-type heme-copper oxidases are manifested in the lack in cbb3
	of most of the amino acids found to be important for proton pumping
	in the A-type, as well as in the different binding characteristics
	of ligands such as CO, O2 and NO. Investigations of the reasons for
	these differences at a molecular level have provided insights into
	the mechanism of O2 and NO reduction as well as the proton-pumping
	mechanism in all heme-copper oxidases. In this paper, we discuss
	results from these studies with the focus on the relationship between
	proton transfer and ligand binding and reduction. In addition, we
	present new data, which show that CO binding to one of the c-type
	hemes of CcoP is modulated by protein-lipid interactions in the membrane.
	These results show that the heme c-CO binding can be used as a probe
	of protein-membrane interactions in cbb3 oxidases, and possible physiological
	consequences for this behavior are discussed.},

	have important immunomodulatory effects on the host during infection.
	Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanism
	of the nitric oxide reductase gene (norB) needs to be elucidated.
	To accomplish this, we analysed the functional regions of the norB
	upstream region. The promoter contains an extended -10 motif (TGNTACAAT)
	that is required for high-level expression. Deletion and substitution
	analysis of the norB upstream region revealed that no sequence upstream
	of the -10 motif is involved in norB regulation under anaerobic conditions
	or in the presence of NO. However, replacement of a 29 bp inverted
	repeat sequence immediately downstream of the extended -10 motif
	gave high levels of aerobic expression of a norB : : lacZ fusion.
	Insertional inactivation of gonococcal nsrR, predicted to bind to
	this inverted repeat sequence, resulted in the loss of norB repression
	and eliminated NO induction capacity. Single-copy complementation
	of nsrR in trans restored regulation of both norB transcription and
	NorB activity by NO. In Escherichia coli, expression of a gonococcal
	nsrR gene repressed gonococcal norB; induction of norB occurred in
	the presence of exogenously added NO. NsrR also regulates aniA and
	dnrN, as well as its own expression. We also determined that Fur
	regulates norB by a novel indirect activation method, by preventing
	the binding of a gonococcal ArsR homologue, a second repressor whose
	putative binding site overlaps the Fur binding site.},

	increase in the activity of an artificial ATP-using system stimulates
	mitochondria mainly via changes in [ADP], while changes in [ATP]
	and [P(i)] play only a minor role; (2) in non-excitable tissues (e.g.

	(via some cytosolic factor(s)) in parallel all the steps of oxidative
	phosphorylation together with ATP usage and substrate dehydrogenation;
	(4) the decrease in the flux through cytochrome oxidase caused by
	a decrease in oxygen concentration is, at least partially, compensated
	by a decrease in Delta p and increase in the reduction level of cytochrome

	genetic switches that randomly turn genes on and off, occur in many
	pathogenic bacterial populations and confer adaptive advantages to
	new environments and evasion of host immune responses. This is often
	mediated by spontaneous changes in the length of short DNA sequence
	repeats located in protein-coding regions or upstream regulatory
	regions, leading to deactivation or alteration of the associated
	genes. In this study we describe how a repeat sequence, distally

	adhesin of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>. We identify the major
	mediator of this control, a negative regulator NadR, which binds
	to sequences flanking the variable repeat. Changes in the spacing
	between these sequences affect the ability of NadR to shut down expression
	from the promoter. We also identify a relevant metabolite that can
	block NadR activity and therefore act as a signal to induce adhesin
	expression. This finding sheds new light on the role of DNA-repeats
	identified in intergenic regions for which no role could be hypothesised,
	and may be a model mechanism used by bacterial pathogens for fine-tuning
	diversity within the host. Elucidating these mechanisms can aid in

  abstract = {Recent earth science studies have pointed out that massive acceleration
	of the global nitrogen cycle by anthropogenic addition of bio-available
	nitrogen has led to a host of environmental problems. Nitrous oxide
	(N(2)O) is a greenhouse gas that is an intermediate during the biological
	process known as denitrification. Copper-containing nitrite reductase
	(CuNIR) is a key enzyme in the process; it produces a precursor for
	N(2)O by catalysing the one-electron reduction of nitrite (NO2-)
	to nitric oxide (NO). The reduction step is performed by an efficient
	electron-transfer reaction with a redox-partner protein. However,
	details of the mechanism during the electron-transfer reaction are
	still unknown. Here we show the high-resolution crystal structure
	of the electron-transfer complex for CuNIR with its cognate cytochrome
	c as the electron donor. The hydrophobic electron-transfer path is
	formed at the docking interface by desolvation owing to close contact
	between the two proteins. Structural analysis of the interface highlights
	an essential role for the loop region with a hydrophobic patch for
	protein-protein recognition; it also shows how interface construction
	allows the variation in atomic components to achieve diverse biological
	electron transfers.},

	AniA and NorB. P(aniA) is activated by FNR (regulator of fumarate
	and nitrate reduction), the two-component regulatory system NarQ-NarP,
	and induced by nitrite; P(norB) is induced by NO independently of
	FNR by an uncharacterized mechanism. We report the results of microarray
	analysis, bioinformatic analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation,
	which revealed that only five genes with readily identified NarP-binding
	sites are differentially expressed in narP(+) and narP strains. These
	include three genes implicated in the truncated gonococcal denitrification
	pathway: aniA, norB, and narQ. We also report that (i) nitrite induces
	aniA transcription in a narP mutant; (ii) nitrite induction involves
	indirect inactivation by nitric oxide of a gonococcal repressor,
	NsrR, identified from a multigenome bioinformatic study; (iii) in
	an nsrR mutant, aniA, norB, and dnrN (encoding a putative reactive
	nitrogen species response protein) were expressed constitutively
	in the absence of nitrite, suggesting that NsrR is the only NO-sensing
	transcription factor in N. gonorrhoeae; and (iv) NO rather than nitrite
	is the ligand to which NsrR responds. When expressed in Escherichia
	coli, gonococcal NarQ and chimaeras of E. coli and gonococcal NarQ
	are ligand-insensitive and constitutively active: a "locked-on" phenotype.
	We conclude that genes involved in the truncated denitrification
	pathway of N. gonorrhoeae are key components of the small NarQP regulon,
	that NarP indirectly regulates P(norB) by stimulating NO production
	by AniA, and that NsrR plays a critical role in enabling gonococci

  abstract = {Acquisition of iron and iron complexes has long been recognized as
	a major determinant in the pathogenesis of Neisseria meningitidis.
	In this review, high-affinity iron uptake systems, which allow meningococci
	to utilize the human host proteins transferrin, lactoferrin, hemoglobin,
	and haptoglobin-hemoglobin as sources of essential iron, are described.
	Classic features of bacterial iron transport systems, such as regulation
	by the iron-responsive repressor Fur and TonB-dependent transport
	activity, are discussed, as well as more specific features of meningococcal
	iron transport. Our current understanding of how N. meningitidis
	acquires iron from the human host and the vaccine potentials of various
	components of these iron transport systems are also reviewed.},

	japonicum fixGHIS genes, which map immediately downstream of the
	fixNOQP operon for the symbiotically essential cbb3-type heme-copper
	oxidase complex. Expression of fixGHIS, like that of fixNOQP, is
	strongly induced in cells grown microaerobically or anaerobically.
	A fixGHI deletion led to the same prominent phenotypes as those known
	from a fixNOQP deletion: defective symbiotic nitrogen fixation (Fix-)
	and decreased cytochrome oxidase activity in cells grown under oxygen
	deprivation. Only traces, if any, of cytochrome cbb3 subunits were
	present in membranes isolated from the delta fixGHI strain, as revealed
	by Western blot analysis with subunit-specific antibodies. This effect
	was not due to lack of fixNOQP transcription. The results suggested
	a critical involvement of the fixGHIS gene products in the assembly
	and/or stability of the cbb3-type heme-copper oxidase. On the basis
	of sequence similarities between the FixI protein and a Cu-transporting
	P-type ATPase (CopA) of Enterococcus hirae, and between FixG and
	a membrane-bound oxidoreductase (RdxA) of Rhodobacter sphaeroides,

	quinol oxidase, cytochrome bo3, using flow-flash and stopped flow
	techniques. This enzyme belongs to the heme-copper oxidase family
	but lacks the CuA center of the cytochrome c oxidases. Depending
	on the isolation procedure, the kinetics are found to be either nearly
	monophasic and very different from those of cytochrome c oxidase
	or multiphasic and quite similar to cytochrome c oxidase. The multiphasic
	kinetics in cytochrome c oxidase can largely be attributed to the
	presence Of CuA as the donor of a fourth electron, which rereduces
	the originally oxidized low-spin heme and completes the reduction
	of O2 to water. Monophasic kinetics would thus be expected, a priori,
	for cytochrome bo3 since it lacks the CuA center, and in this case
	we show that the oxygen reaction is incomplete and ends with the
	ferryl intermediate. Multiphasic kinetics thus suggest the presence
	of an extra electron donor (analogous to CuA). We observe such kinetics
	exclusively with cytochrome bo3 that contains a single equivalent
	of bound ubiquinone-8, whereas we find no bound ubiquinone in an
	enzyme exhibiting monophasic kinetics. Reconstitution with ubiquinone-8
	converts the reaction kinetics from monophasic to multiphasic. We
	conclude that a single bound ubiquinone molecule in cytochrome bo3
	is capable of fast rereduction of heme b and that the reaction with
	O2 is quite similar in quinol and cytochrome c oxidases.},

	Scanning electron microscopy revealed fibrils surrounding wild-type

	Similar amounts of type IV pili and pilus-associated cytochromes

  abstract = {Heme-copper oxygen reductases (HCO) reduce O(2) to water being the
	last enzymatic complexes of most aerobic respiratory chains. These
	enzymes promote energy conservation coupling the catalytic reaction
	to charge separation and charge translocation across the prokaryotic
	cytoplasmatic or mitochondrial membrane. In this way they contribute
	to the establishment and maintenance of the transmembrane difference
	of electrochemical potential, which is vital for solute/nutrient
	cell import, synthesis of ATP and motility. The HCO enzymes most
	probably share with the nitric oxide reductases, NORs, a common ancestor.
	We have proposed the classification of HCOs into three different
	types, A, B and C; based on the constituents of their proton channels
	(Pereira, Santana and Teixeira (2001) Biochim Biophys Acta, 1505,
	185-208). This classification was recently challenged by the suggestion
	of other different types of HCOs. Using an enlarged sampling we performed
	an exhaustive bioinformatic reanalysis of HCOs family. Our results
	strengthened our previously proposed classification and showed no
	need for the existence of more divisions. Now, we analyze the taxonomic
	distribution of HCOs and NORs and the congruence of their sequence
	trees with the 16S rRNA tree. We observed that HCOs are widely distributed
	in the two prokaryotic domains and that the different types of enzymes
	are not confined to a specific taxonomic group or environmental niche.

	The AniA protein was always expressed, except for these two carriers
	strains and for other two strains in which the presence of the premature
	stop codons was recognized. The biochemical properties of the cloned
	soluble domain of the enzyme (sAniA) from N. meningitidis reference

	particular, biochemical analysis of sAniA from MC58 demonstrated
	a clear dependence of its catalytic activity upon acidification,
	while the clinical isolate-derived sAniA was not functional. Thus,
	the results obtained suggest that the presence of a conserved and

  abstract = {Biogenesis of respiratory cytochromes is defined as consisting of
	the posttranslational processes that are necessary to assemble apoprotein,
	heme, and sometimes additional cofactors into mature enzyme complexes
	with electron transfer functions. Different biochemical reactions
	take place during maturation: (i) targeting of the apoprotein to
	or through the cytoplasmic membrane to its subcellular destination;
	(ii) proteolytic processing of precursor forms; (iii) assembly of
	subunits in the membrane and oligomerization; (iv) translocation
	and/or modification of heme and covalent or noncovalent binding to
	the protein moiety; (v) transport, processing, and incorporation
	of other cofactors; and (vi) folding and stabilization of the protein.
	These steps are discussed for the maturation of different oxidoreductase
	complexes, and they are arranged in a linear pathway to best account
	for experimental findings from studies concerning cytochrome biogenesis.
	The example of the best-studied case, i.e., maturation of cytochrome
	c, appears to consist of a pathway that requires at least nine specific
	genes and more general cellular functions such as protein secretion
	or the control of the redox state in the periplasm. Covalent attachment
	of heme appears to be enzyme catalyzed and takes place in the periplasm
	after translocation of the precursor through the membrane. The genetic
	characterization and the putative biochemical functions of cytochrome
	c-specific maturation proteins suggest that they may be organized
	in a membrane-bound maturase complex. Formation of the multisubunit
	cytochrome bc, complex and several terminal oxidases of the bo3,
	bd, aa3, and cbb3 types is discussed in detail, and models for linear

	both of these types of the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase are present

  abstract = {During periods of endemic disease, about 10 \% of the general population
	harbour Neisseria meningitidis in the nasopharynx. Since N. meningitidis
	is a strict human pathogen and most patients have not been in contact
	with other cases, asymptomatic carriers are presumably the major
	source of the pathogenic strains. Most carrier isolates are shown
	to lack capsule production. The capsule deficient state of meningococcal
	strains in the nasopharynx may aid evasion of the human immune defence
	and hence be selected to survive nasopharyngeal colonization. Carriage
	itself can be an immunizing process resulting in systemic protective
	antibody responses. Frequent nasopharyngeal colonization with related
	bacteria like Neisseria lactamica improves natural immunity to meningococci
	by the formation of cross-reacting antibodies. While most meningococcal
	strains recovered from patients belong to a limited number of clonal
	groups worldwide, strains isolated from carriers comprise numerous
	genotypes, with only a small proportion of the strains representing
	invasive clones. During the carriage state, co-colonization with
	other pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria may lead to genetic
	exchange, which may result in the emergence of new meningococcal
	clones. The high diversity of meningococcal carrier strains, compared
	with hypervirulent strains, supports the idea that transmissibility,
	not invasion, is essential in the life cycle of N. meningitidis.},

  abstract = {The Bradyrhizobium japonicum cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase, which supports
	microaerobic respiration, is a multisubunit enzyme encoded by the
	genes of the fixNOQP operon. We investigated the contribution of
	the individual subunits to function and assembly of the membrane-bound
	complex. In-frame deletion mutants of fixN, fixO, and fixQ, and an
	insertion mutant of fixP were constructed. All mutants, except the
	fixQ mutant, showed clearly altered absorption difference spectra
	of their membranes and decreased oxidase activities, and they were
	unable to fix nitrogen symbiotically. The presence of the individual
	subunits was assayed by Western blot analysis, using subunit-specific
	antibodies, and by heme staining of the c-type cytochromes FixO and
	FixP. These analyses led to the following conclusions: (i) FixN and
	FixO are necessary for assembly of the multimeric oxidase, (ii) FixN
	and FixO assemble independently of FixP, and (iii) FixQ is not required
	for complex formation and, therefore, does not seem to be an essential
	subunit. The possible oxidase biogenesis pathway involves the formation
	of a primary core complex consisting of FixN and FixO, which allows
	the subsequent association with FixP to form the complete enzyme.},
