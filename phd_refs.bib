	by removing CO with a laser flash; (c) probing the reaction mixture
	for photosensitivity with a second laser flash. Photosensitivity
	appears in the reaction mixture after the first laser flash, reaches
	a maximum after 50-60 microseconds ([O2] greater than 100 microM),
	and disappears in a further 50-100 microseconds. The kinetics can

	Species C is the photosensitive a3II.O2 complex, and in D, a3 iron
	has been oxidized. The formation of species C is responsible for
	the rapid phase of absorbance change in the oxidase-oxygen reaction.
	The rate of reaction with oxygen approaches the limit of 35,000 s-1

	that the population of Neisseria meningitidis (Nm), a deadly human
	pathogen, is structured in distinct lineages. Given that the Nm population
	undergoes substantial recombination, the mechanisms resulting in
	the evolution of these lineages, their persistence in time, and the
	implications for the pathogenicity of the bacterium are not yet completely
	understood. Based on whole-genome sequencing, we show that Nm is
	structured in phylogenetic clades. Through acquisition of specific
	genes and through insertions and rearrangements, each clade has acquired
	and remodeled specific genomic tracts, with the potential to impact
	on the commensal and virulence behavior of Nm. Despite this clear
	evidence of a structured population, we confirm high rates of detectable
	recombination throughout the whole Nm chromosome. However, gene conversion
	events were found to be longer within clades than between clades,
	suggesting a DNA cleavage mechanism associated with the phylogeny
	of the species. We identify 22 restriction modification systems,
	probably acquired by horizontal gene transfer from outside of the
	species/genus, whose distribution in the different strains coincides
	with the phylogenetic clade structure. We provide evidence that these
	clade-associated restriction modification systems generate a differential
	barrier to DNA exchange consistent with the observed population structure.
	These findings have general implications for the emergence of lineage
	structure and virulence in recombining bacterial populations, and
	they could provide an evolutionary framework for the population biology
	of a number of other bacterial species that show contradictory population
	structure and dynamics.},

  abstract = {The respiratory chain of Vibrio cholerae contains three bd-type quinol
	oxygen reductases as well as one cbb(3) oxygen reductase. The cbb(3)
	oxygen reductase has been previously isolated and characterized;
	however, the natural mobile electron donor(s) that shuttles electrons
	between the bc(1) complex and the cbb(3) oxygen reductase is not
	known. The most likely candidates are the diheme cytochrome c(4)
	and monoheme cytochrome c(5), which have been previously shown to
	be present in the periplasm of aerobically grown cultures of V. cholerae.
	Both cytochromes c(4) and c(5) from V. cholerae have been cloned
	and expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli. It is shown that
	reduced cytochrome c(4) is a substrate for the purified cbb(3) oxygen
	reductase and can support steady state oxygen reductase activity
	of at least 300 e(-1)/s. In contrast, reduced cytochrome c(5) is
	not a good substrate for the cbb(3) oxygen reductase. Surprisingly,
	the dependence of the oxygen reductase activity on the concentration
	of cytochrome c(4) does not exhibit saturation. Global spectroscopic
	analysis of the time course of the oxidation of cytochrome c(4) indicates
	that the apparent lack of saturation is due to the strong dependence
	of K(M) and V(max) on the concentration of oxidized cytochrome c(4).
	Whether this is an artifact of the in vitro assay or has physiological
	significance remains unknown. Cyclic voltammetry was used to determine
	that the midpoint potentials of the two hemes in cytochrome c(4)
	are 240 and 340 mV (vs standard hydrogen electrode), similar to the
	electrochemical properties of other c(4)-type cytochromes. Genomic
	analysis shows a strong correlation between the presence of a c(4)-type
	cytochrome and a cbb(3) oxygen reductase within the beta- and gamma-proteobacterial
	clades, suggesting that cytochrome c(4) is the likely natural electron
	donor to the cbb(3) oxygen reductases within these organisms. These
	would include the beta-proteobacteria Neisseria meningitidis and
	Neisseria gonnorhoeae, in which the cbb(3) oxygen reductases are
	the only terminal oxidases in their respiratory chains, and the gamma-proteobacterium
	Pseudomonas stutzeri.},

  abstract = {The only natural reservoir of Neisseria meningitidis is the human
	nasopharyngeal mucosa. Depending on age, climate, country, socioeconomic
	status, and other factors, approximately 10\% of the human population
	harbors meningococci in the nose. However, invasive disease is relatively
	rare, as it occurs only when the following conditions are fulfilled:
	(i) contact with a virulent strain, (ii) colonization by that strain,
	(iii) penetration of the bacterium through the mucosa, and (iv) survival
	and eventually outgrowth of the meningococcus in the bloodstream.
	When the meningococcus has reached the bloodstream and specific antibodies
	are absent, as is the case for young children or after introduction
	of a new strain in a population, the ultimate outgrowth depends on
	the efficacy of the innate immune response. Massive outgrowth leads
	within 12 h to fulminant meningococcal sepsis (FMS), characterized
	by high intravascular concentrations of endotoxin that set free high
	concentrations of proinflammatory mediators. These mediators belonging
	to the complement system, the contact system, the fibrinolytic system,
	and the cytokine system induce shock and diffuse intravascular coagulation.
	FMS can be fatal within 24 h, often before signs of meningitis have
	developed. In spite of the increasing possibilities for treatment
	in intensive care units, the mortality rate of FMS is still 30\%.
	When the outgrowth of meningococci in the bloodstream is impeded,
	seeding of bacteria in the subarachnoidal compartment may lead to
	overt meningitis within 24 to 36 h. With appropriate antibiotics
	and good clinical surveillance, the mortality rate of this form of
	invasive disease is 1 to 2\%. The overall mortality rate of meningococcal
	disease can only be reduced when patients without meningitis, i.e.,
	those who may develop FMS, are recognized early. This means that
	the fundamental nature of the disease as a meningococcus septicemia
	deserves more attention.},

	of the transcriptional activator fumarate and nitrate reductase regulator
	from the pathogenic bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (NmFNR). Like
	its homologue from Escherichia coli (EcFNR), NmFNR binds a 4Fe-4S
	cluster, which breaks down in the presence of oxygen to a 2Fe-2S
	cluster and subsequently to apo-FNR. The kinetics of NmFNR cluster
	disassembly in the presence of oxygen are 2â3Ã slower than those
	previously reported for wild-type EcFNR, but similar to constitutively
	active EcFNR* mutants, consistent with earlier work in which we reported
	that the activity of FNR-dependent promoters in N. meningitidis is
	only weakly inhibited by the presence of oxygen (Rock, J. D., Thomson,
	M. J., Read, R. C., and Moir, J. W. (2007) J. Bacteriol. 189, 1138â1144).
	NmFNR binds to DNA containing a consensus FNR box sequence, and this
	binding stabilizes the iron-sulfur cluster in the presence of oxygen.
	Partial degradation of the 4Fe-4S cluster to a 3Fe-4S occurs, and
	this form remains bound to the DNA. The 3Fe-4S cluster is converted
	spontaneously back to a 4Fe-4S cluster under subsequent anaerobic
	reducing conditions in the presence of ferrous iron. The finding
	that binding to DNA stabilizes FNR in the presence of oxygen such
	that it has a half-life of â¼30 min on the DNA has implications
	for our appreciation of how oxygen switches off FNR activatable genes
	in vivo.},

  abstract = {In Impedance Microbiology, the time during which the measuring equipment
	is connected to the bipolar cells is rather long, usually between
	6 to 24 hrs for microorganisms with duplication times in the order
	of less than one hour and concentrations ranging from 10(1) to 10(7)
	[CFU/ml]. Under these conditions, the electrode-electrolyte interface
	impedance may show a slow drift of about 2\%/hr. By and large, growth
	curves superimposed on such drift do not stabilize, are less reproducible,
	and keep on distorting all over the measurement of the temporal reactive
	or resistive records due to interface changes, in turn originated
	in bacterial activity. This problem has been found when growth curves
	were obtained by means of impedance analyzers or with impedance bridges
	using different types of operational amplifiers.Suspecting that the
	input circuitry was the culprit of the deleterious effect, we used
	for that matter (a) ultra-low bias current amplifiers, (b) isolating
	relays for the selection of cells, and (c) a shorter connection time,
	so that the relays were maintained opened after the readings, to
	bring down such spurious drift to a negligible value. Bacterial growth
	curves were obtained in order to test their quality.It was demonstrated
	that the drift decreases ten fold when the circuit remained connected
	to the cell for a short time between measurements, so that the distortion
	became truly negligible. Improvement due to better-input amplifiers
	was not as good as by reducing the connection time. Moreover, temperature
	effects were insignificant with a regulation of +/- 0.2 [ degrees
	C]. Frequency did not influence either.The drift originated either
	at the dc input bias offset current (Ios) of the integrated circuits,
	or in discrete transistors connected directly to the electrodes immersed
	in the cells, depending on the particular circuit arrangement. Reduction
	of the connection time was the best countermeasure.},

	have important immunomodulatory effects on the host during infection.
	Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanism
	of the nitric oxide reductase gene (norB) needs to be elucidated.
	To accomplish this, we analysed the functional regions of the norB
	upstream region. The promoter contains an extended -10 motif (TGNTACAAT)
	that is required for high-level expression. Deletion and substitution
	analysis of the norB upstream region revealed that no sequence upstream
	of the -10 motif is involved in norB regulation under anaerobic conditions
	or in the presence of NO. However, replacement of a 29 bp inverted
	repeat sequence immediately downstream of the extended -10 motif
	gave high levels of aerobic expression of a norB : : lacZ fusion.
	Insertional inactivation of gonococcal nsrR, predicted to bind to
	this inverted repeat sequence, resulted in the loss of norB repression
	and eliminated NO induction capacity. Single-copy complementation
	of nsrR in trans restored regulation of both norB transcription and
	NorB activity by NO. In Escherichia coli, expression of a gonococcal
	nsrR gene repressed gonococcal norB; induction of norB occurred in
	the presence of exogenously added NO. NsrR also regulates aniA and
	dnrN, as well as its own expression. We also determined that Fur
	regulates norB by a novel indirect activation method, by preventing
	the binding of a gonococcal ArsR homologue, a second repressor whose
	putative binding site overlaps the Fur binding site.},

	Overexpression of dinB enhanced the instability of the homopolymeric
	tract associated with siaD. Investigation of the dam locus in a population

	between these sequences affect the ability of NadR to shut down expression
	from the promoter. We also identify a relevant metabolite that can

	expression. This finding sheds new light on the role of DNA-repeats

	(N(2)O) is a greenhouse gas that is an intermediate during the biological
	process known as denitrification. Copper-containing nitrite reductase
	(CuNIR) is a key enzyme in the process; it produces a precursor for
	N(2)O by catalysing the one-electron reduction of nitrite (NO2-)
	to nitric oxide (NO). The reduction step is performed by an efficient
	electron-transfer reaction with a redox-partner protein. However,
	details of the mechanism during the electron-transfer reaction are
	still unknown. Here we show the high-resolution crystal structure
	of the electron-transfer complex for CuNIR with its cognate cytochrome
	c as the electron donor. The hydrophobic electron-transfer path is
	formed at the docking interface by desolvation owing to close contact

	an essential role for the loop region with a hydrophobic patch for

	to GSU1505 in trans. The {Delta}1501 mutant demonstrated limited
	cell-cell agglutination, enhanced attachment to negatively charged
	surfaces, and poor attachment to positively charged poly-D-lysine-

	standard hydrogen electrode [SHE]), {Delta}1501 mutant cells detached.
	Scanning electron microscopy revealed fibrils surrounding wild-type
	G. sulfurreducens which were absent from the {Delta}1501 mutant.
	Similar amounts of type IV pili and pilus-associated cytochromes

	matrix of c-type cytochromes and other proteins bound to polysaccharides.
	The matrix from the mutant contained 60% less sugar and was nearly
	devoid of c-type cytochromes such as OmcZ. The addition of wild-type

	bound wild-type cells and extracellular matrix material over mutant

	by formation of the cytochrome a3 nitrosyl complex. In addition,
	peroxynitrite causes irreversible inhibition of cytochrome oxidase,
	characterized by a decreased Vmax and a raised Km for oxygen. Under
	these conditions, the redox state of cytochrome a is elevated, indicating
	inhibition of electron transfer and/or oxygen reduction reactions
	subsequent to this center. The lipid bilayer is no barrier to these
	peroxynitrite effects, as NO production and irreversible enzyme inhibition
	were also observed in cytochrome oxidase proteoliposomes. Addition
	of 50 {micro}M peroxynitrite to 10 {micro}M fully oxidized enzyme

	cytochrome a3, partial reduction of cytochrome a, and irreversible
	damage to the CuA site. Higher concentrations of peroxynitrite (250

	causes a red shift in the optical spectrum of both cytochromes a
	and a3, resulting in a symmetrical peak in the visible region. Therefore,
	peroxynitrite can both modify and degrade the metal centers of cytochrome
	oxidase.},

	(serogroup B), a causative agent of meningitis and septicemia, contains
	2158 predicted coding regions, 1158 (53.7\%) of which were assigned
	a biological role. Three major islands of horizontal DNA transfer
	were identified; two of these contain genes encoding proteins involved
	in pathogenicity, and the third island contains coding sequences
	only for hypothetical proteins. Insights into the commensal and virulence
	behavior of N. meningitidis can be gleaned from the genome, in which
	sequences for structural proteins of the pilus are clustered and
	several coding regions unique to serogroup B capsular polysaccharide
	synthesis can be identified. Finally, N. meningitidis contains more
	genes that undergo phase variation than any pathogen studied to date,
	a mechanism that controls their expression and contributes to the
	evasion of the host immune system.},

  abstract = {Biogenesis of respiratory cytochromes is defined as consisting of
	the posttranslational processes that are necessary to assemble apoprotein,
	heme, and sometimes additional cofactors into mature enzyme complexes
	with electron transfer functions. Different biochemical reactions
	take place during maturation: (i) targeting of the apoprotein to
	or through the cytoplasmic membrane to its subcellular destination;
	(ii) proteolytic processing of precursor forms; (iii) assembly of
	subunits in the membrane and oligomerization; (iv) translocation
	and/or modification of heme and covalent or noncovalent binding to
	the protein moiety; (v) transport, processing, and incorporation
	of other cofactors; and (vi) folding and stabilization of the protein.
	These steps are discussed for the maturation of different oxidoreductase
	complexes, and they are arranged in a linear pathway to best account
	for experimental findings from studies concerning cytochrome biogenesis.
	The example of the best-studied case, i.e., maturation of cytochrome
	c, appears to consist of a pathway that requires at least nine specific
	genes and more general cellular functions such as protein secretion
	or the control of the redox state in the periplasm. Covalent attachment
	of heme appears to be enzyme catalyzed and takes place in the periplasm
	after translocation of the precursor through the membrane. The genetic
	characterization and the putative biochemical functions of cytochrome
	c-specific maturation proteins suggest that they may be organized
	in a membrane-bound maturase complex. Formation of the multisubunit
	cytochrome bc, complex and several terminal oxidases of the bo3,
	bd, aa3, and cbb3 types is discussed in detail, and models for linear
	maturation pathways are proposed wherever possible.},

  abstract = {Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a prolific source of c-type cytochromes.
	Five of the constitutively expressed cytochromes are predicted, based
	on in silico analysis of the N. gonorrhoeae genome, to be components
	of the cytochrome bc1 complex, cytochrome c oxidase cbb3 or periplasmic
	cytochromes involved in electron transfer reactions typical of a
	bacterium with a microaerobic physiology. Cytochrome c peroxidase
	was previously shown to be a lipoprotein expressed only during oxygen-limited
	growth. The final c-type cytochrome, cytochrome c', similar to cytochrome
	c peroxidase, includes a lipobox required for targeting to the outer
	membrane. Maturation of cytochrome c' was partially inhibited by
	globomycin, an antibiotic that specifically inhibits signal peptidase
	II, resulting in the accumulation of the prolipoprotein in the cytoplasmic
	membrane. Disruption of the gonococcal cycP gene resulted in an extended
	lag phase during microaerobic growth in the presence but not in the
	absence of nitrite, suggesting that cytochrome c' protects the bacteria
	from NO generated by nitrite reduction during adaptation to oxygen-limited
	growth. The cytochrome c' gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli
	and recombinant cytochrome c' was shown to be targeted to the outer
	membrane. Spectroscopic evidence is presented showing that gonococcal
	cytochrome c' is similar to previously characterized cytochrome c'
	proteins and that it binds NO in vitro. The demonstration that two
	of the seven gonococcal c-type cytochromes fulfil specialized functions
	and are outer membrane lipoproteins suggests that the localization
	of these lipoproteins close to the bacterial surface provides effective
	protection against external assaults from reactive oxygen and reactive
	nitrogen species.},
