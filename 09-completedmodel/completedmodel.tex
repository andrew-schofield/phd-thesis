\chapter{Discussion and Completed Model}
\label{chap:completedmodel}
%Therefore I have integrated microbiological techniques with mathematical modelling principles to allow us to understand the system in a way previously not possible. I have constructed a mathematical model which describes \Nsm{} respiration \textit{in silico} and can produce predictions for the system \textit{in vivo}. To parametrise this model I used a novel integrative scheme where a standard Bayesian fitting methodology is interleaved with iterative experimental data collection on progressively more complex respiratory scenarios.
