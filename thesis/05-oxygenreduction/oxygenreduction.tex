\section{Aerobic Reduction of Oxygen}
\subsection{Introduction}
The first dataset I used in my iterative approach to parameter estimation was of a simple oxygen reduction experiment carried out in aerobic conditions. This dataset is the simplest biologically as under aerobic conditions and without the presence of any microaerobic substrates (nitrite or nitric oxide) the only respiratory pathway that is active is the oxygen reducing one. Additionally, the other parts of a respiratory chain influence the oxygen reducing pathway either by competing for electrons, or chemically inhibiting it. The relevant portions of the electron transport chain are shown graphically in Figure \ref{fig:o2_resp_chain}.

In the mathematical model all of the purple elements (cytochromes) are amalgamated into one entity.

\end{figure}

The equations that describe this portion of the electron transport chain are:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d[O_2]}{dt} & = & \beta(1-[O_2]/K_O) - k_{1}[C_a][O_2]\\
\frac{d[Q_a]}{dt} & = & g([Q] - [Q_a]) - l_3[Q_a]([B] - [B_a]) - f[Q_a]([X]-[E])\\
\frac{d[E]}{dt} & = & -k_3([C] - [C_a] - [C_X])[E]  - m_3([A] - [A_a])[E] + f[Q_a]([X]-[E])\\
\frac{d[C_a]}{dt} & = & k_3([C] - [C_a] - [C_X])[E] - k_{1}[C_a][O_2] - k_5[C_a][NO]
\end{eqnarray*}
These equations describe the change in concentration of oxygen over time, which is the experimentally observable value, the reduction state of the quinone pool and the reduction state of the cytochrome ``pool''. This portion of the model involved 13 parameters and variables which I tried to estimate (the model actually contains 17 such parameters and variables, but under these conditions the remaining 4 are set to 0 as they are related to nitrite reduction effects).

\subsection{Experimental Results}

Generation of oxygen reduction datasets required the growth of MC58 (wild-type \Nsm{}) in aerobic conditions until mid log-phase growth had been achieved. This corresponds to $\mathrm{OD}_{600}$ of 0.3-0.9 and usually required an incubation period of roughly 3 hours. Once the required cell density had been obtained, I transferred the culture to the oxygen electrode chamber and recorded the oxygen concentration as the culture respired. At this point the cells are only using whatever amount of oxygen is presently dissolved in the culture medium in addition to that diffusing in through the cap (negligible). Once the culture had used up all its dissolved oxygen, I removed the electrode chamber cap and aerated the culture media using a pastuer pipette. This restores oxygen levels throughout the culture and allows the bacteria to continue respiring in aerobic conditions. In many cases if the culture is allowed to become completely anaerobic for a prolonged period of time, the bacteria will die, evidenced by a subsequent lack of oxygen reduction, however this is not always the case as shown in Figure \ref{fig:repeat_oxy_with_delay}. It is therefore advisable to aerate the culture before the oxygen level reaches zero. A typical oxygen reduction plot is shown in Figure \ref{fig:oxy_repeatable_chl}. This is split into individual reduction sections, which can then be used as input data for parameter estimation.


The experiments used to generate data for oxygen reduction are highly repeatable and consistently generate the same basic result of a linear reduction of oxygen with time.

Also of note is that nitric oxide concentration is not changing, suggesting that reduction of nitrite is not occuring either.

\subsubsection{Generation of Prior Probability Distributions}
In accordance with the integrative scheme I introduced in Chapter \ref{chap:paramest}, I attempted to estimate the distributions of the parameters involved in modelling these data. In order to do this I needed to create probability distributions to act as priors to feed into the estimation system as I am using a Bayesian approach. These probability distributions were generated from data obtained in the published literature, which is described in Chapter \ref{chap:model}, and preliminary experimental data. I assumed that all the prior probabilities would be normally distributed, therefore the distributions I used were created under the following scheme:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Where the literature value had bounds associated with it (i.e. published with $\pm{}$ values), I assumed that the bounds covered $3 \sigma$ of the normal distribution. This essentially assumes that 99.7\% of the distribution falls within the given bounds.
	\item Where the literature value has no bounds associated with it (i.e. published as a single figure), I assumed that a range of $\pm 10\%$ was covered by $3 \sigma$ of the normal distribution. This means that 99.7\% of the distribution falls within $\pm 10\%$ of the given value.
	\item Where there are no literature values available, the value was estimated based on preliminary experimental data and no bounds were associated. In this case the prior was free to be perturbed giving it an effective range of $0 < x < \infty$.
\end{itemize}
With reference to the above, the initial probability distributions used to start the Monte-Carlo run are shown in Figure \ref{fig:oxypriors}. As can be seen, very little information is readily available in the literature to populate the model.

These are the probability distributions used as priors by the parameter estimation algorithm. Where no values were available in the literature, the probability distribution represents a flat prior from 0 to $\infty$ with the initial value being determined by preliminary experiment.

\subsubsection{Parameter Estimation Results}
The parameter estimation process produces a large amount of output data which can be processed. Included in these data are the best simulation results from each run. Best is defined here as the simulation with the lowest fitness value, i.e. the one with the closest match to the experimental data. For the oxygen reduction training datasets, of which there are 3, each was run 20 times for 20,000 iterations. This lower iteration count was chosen as a compromise between execution time and statistical accuracy. In fact given that the burn-in time for these runs was relatively short, 20,000 iterations still provides plenty of data. A representative example of the simulated data is shown in Figure \ref{fig:o2sim}. This figure was generated from the set of parameters that produced the most fit output compared to the input dataset.

The high affinity of $\mathrm{cbb}_3$ for oxygen is evidenced by very little non-linearity at low oxygen concentrations. The solved output is a representative result of the parameter estimation system.

\end{figure}

Initially the simulation results are not particularly good fits compared to the experimental data and as such have high ``fitness values''. As the parameter estimation progresses the ``fitness value'' reduces as the simulated result gets closer and closer to the experimental data. Quite often this does not take many iterations and a representative plot showing how the simulation's ``fitness value'' decreases is shown in Figure \ref{fig:oxy_fitness}. The initial period where the ``fitness value'' is high up until the point it settles at a lower value is classed as ``burn-in'' and is discarded when generating posterior distributions.

Initially the fitness value is high showing that the simulated result does not match the experimental dataset. As the parameter estimation algorithm progresses, the fitness value decreases as the simulated result approaches the experimental dataset. The inset shows a zoomed in view of the fitness value after the ``burn-in'' process has finished.

\subsection{Discussion}
The experimental dataset shows that oxygen reduction in \textit{Neisseria meningitidis} is a simple linear system with the reductase having a high affinity for oxygen demonstrated by the almost complete lack of non-linearity as oxygen concentration approaches zero. This apparent simple linearity could be modelled with a high degree of accuracy with just 2 parameters in a simple $y=-mx+c$ system. However this does mean that the posterior distributions generated are very wide and therefore allows much greater freedom for the next dataset to explore the parameter space.

Given our knowledge of the underlying transport chain and the affinity of \cbbthree{} for oxygen, we expect a linear reduction of oxygen with high affinity over nearly two orders of magnitude. It is however remarkable that we can model this behaviour with so few components in the model, as it requires significant changes in the reduction state of the enzymes to achieve this.
