\chapter{Nitrite Reduction in \Nm{}}
\label{chap:nitritereduction}

%In the case of this dataset, nitrite reduction has been modelled very well, but nitric oxide (and to a small extent, oxygen) has not been [Caveat, this may change when the cluster does eventually spit out the complete trajectory. This then could be moved into the discussion about why priors are important]. Not shown in Figure \ref{fig:no2sim} is the concentration of nitric oxide as nitrite is reduced. Unfortunately the parameter set used to generate the solved output assigned a very low value to the concentration of NorB (even though this should have been being expressed), thus the nitric oxide produced by reduction of nitrite does not itself get reduced, and towards the end of the dataset would be lethal to the culture. In this case, a different prior distribution should have been used for NorB concentration, as it was known beforehand that NorB concentration would be non-zero. This is an example of why the prior distributions are important.

\subsection{Introduction}

The last datasets to be used in the iterative approach to parameter estimation was of cultures able to respire nitrite in addition to oxygen. In these cultures nitrite was added to a culture already respiring oxygen to observe both the rate of nitrite reduction, and the effect on oxygen respiration caused by the production of nitric oxide. These datasets were the most complex in terms of the information contained within them and the number of model components needed to solve them. In addition to the components being used to model nitric oxide reduction, the nitrite reduction pathway is also active. The portions of the ETC relating to nitrite reduction are shown graphically in Figure \ref{fig:no2_resp_chain}. However since \Nsm{} is incapable of respiring anaerobically, in actual fact the entire pathway is required, using oxygen nitric oxide and nitrite reduction.

\noindent The equations that describe this portion of the ETC are:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d[O_2]}{dt} & = & \beta(1-[O_2]/K_O) - k_{1}[C_a][O_2]\\
\frac{d[Q_a]}{dt} & = & g([Q] - [Q_a]) - l_3[Q_a]([B] - [B_a]) - f[Q_a]([X]-[X_a])\\
\frac{d[X_a]}{dt} & = & -k_3([C] - [C_a] - [C_X])[X_a]  - m_3([A] - [A_a])[X_a] + f[Q_a]([X]-[X_a])\\
\frac{d[C_a]}{dt} & = & k_3([C] - [C_a] - [C_X])[X_a] - k_{1}[C_a][O_2] - k_5[C_a][NO] + k_6[C_X]\\
\frac{d[NO]}{dt} & = & m_{1}[NO_2^-][A_a] - l_1[NO][B_a] - k_5[C_a][NO] + k_6 [C_X] - \gamma[NO]\\
\frac{d[NO_2^-]}{dt} & = & - m_{1}[NO_2^-][A_a]\\
\frac{d[C_X]}{dt} & = & k_5[C_a][NO] - k_6 [C_X]\\
\frac{d[A_a]}{dt} & = & m_3([A] - [A_a])[X_a]- m_{1}[NO_2^-][A_a]\\
\frac{d[B_a]}{dt} & = & l_3[Q_a]([B] - [B_a]) - l_1[NO][B_a]
\end{eqnarray*}

These equations describe the change in concentration of nitrite over time, which is the experimentally observed value (in addition to the afore modelled oxygen and nitric oxide). Also modelled is the reduction state of AniA. This represents the complete mathematical model not including any transcriptional parameters.

\subsection{Experimental Results}
Generating datasets for Nitrite reduction could be performed in with two different cultures; an aerobic NsrR deficient mutant, or microaerobic wild-type. Microaerobic cultures appeared to grow very poorly during the course of this work and in most cases did not survive the transition from being in the incubator to being moved to the electrode chamber. Therefore an $nsrR^-$ mutant was used instead of the wild-type. This mutant expresses AniA and NorB in a constitutive manner, removing the necessity for growing the cultures in microaerobic conditions. The cultures were grown in aerobic conditions until mid-log phase growth had been achieved. This corresponded to an $OD_{600}$ of $0.3-0.9$ and usually required an incubation period of roughly 3 hours. Once the required cell density had been obtained the culture was transferred to the electrode chamber, Sodium Nitrite was added to a concentration of 1 mM and the nitrite and oxygen concentrations recorded as the culture respired. Unfortunately nitric oxide concentrations could not be recorded as the NO electrode had failed and could not be replaced.

In addition to the datasets obtained from $nsrR^-$ mutant cultures, a further dataset was obtained from \citet{Rock2005} which showed oxygen and nitric oxide concentrations in a microaerobic wild-type culture where nitrite is added partway through aerobic respiration. The datasets generated and used for parametrisation of this portion of the model are shown in Figures \ref{fig:nitriteds1} \& \ref{fig:nitriteds2}.

The dataset in Figure \ref{fig:nitriteds1} shows an $nsrR^-$ mutant which has had 1mM nitrite added at $t=0s$. Nitrite reduction proceeds linearly and at quite a high rate. Oxygen starts linearly but then slows down presumably as nitric oxide is produced ans inhibits \cbbthree{}. It is also possible that given the high rate of nitrite reduction large quantities of nitric oxide are being produced which will react directly with oxygen as described in Chapter \ref{chap:noreduction} affecting the rate of observed oxygen reduction.

The dataset in Figure \ref{fig:nitriteds2} shows a wild-type culture grown in denitrifying conditions, so that it is expressing both AniA and NorB. Nitrite is added at time $t\approx200s$ to a concentration of $\approx 1$ mM (Moir, private communication). Upon nitrite addition a small decrease in oxygen respiration rate is observed, and a large increase in nitric oxide occurs as nitrite is reduced. Nitric oxide is then maintained at a fairly constant level until oxygen is fully reduced at which point a further increase in nitric oxide concentration is observed. It is posited that this final increase in NO concentration is because the electrons that were being pulled through the oxygen respiration pathway are now free to be drawn to AniA allowing more nitrite reduction to take place.

\subsection{Prior Probability Distributions}

As described previously all parameters much have an associated prior probability distribution. The posterior probability distributions from Chapter \ref{chap:noreduction} were used as prior probability distributions in theis chapter. Where new parameters were introduced, the distributions were generated based on published literature values which are noted in Chapter \ref{chap:model}. When using literature values the prior probability distributions were generated according to the same scheme as in Chapter \ref{chap:oxygenreduction}. The values required to create idealised lognormal probability distributions for each parameters are shown in Table

1st results on both datasets don't work very well. o2 reduction rate is too high on my data and norb is non-existent due to limitations in the experimental data, i.e. no fitting done to NO. NO doesn't increase when o2 reduction stops in rock data as it seems that g and f are too high causing X to be effectively permanently reduced. Unknown if NO2- data is correct due to same limitation as above. All 3 cannot reliably be determined at once.

Show all the results figures and the reduction state plots to corroborate.

Re-run simulations: my data broaden k1 and k3 and same for l1 l3 to try and fix both o2 reduction rate an no-non-reduction. C maybe needs to decrease. NO reduction rate should roughly equal O2 reduction rate (in denitrifying conditions) according to \citet{Rock2005}. Therefore l1*B should equal k1*C ish.
Rock data reset to zero and reduce f and g to try and get Q and X to be less reduced to trigger an increase in NO when O2 runs out. Q pool redox states differ (in paracoccus) \cite{Otten1999}.

Plot again with redox states to confirm or reject.

These changes will no doubt break the previous results (o2 and NO), but that is not necessarily a huge problem. The model seems capable of simulating the effect of nitric oxide on oxygen reduction rate, but in order to effect the changes in microaerobic conditions more drastic changes have to be made. This is quite likely as a result of the simplification of the redox chain in that all cytochromes are treated as one entity rather than the 4ish that actually exist. With all cytochromes modelled individually the potential redox state of bc1 could be different to that of cx,c4,c5 which could negate the need to alter f and g to lower the overall reduction state of X. If this is the case it goes a way to explain why the redox chain appears to be so complicated \textit{in vivo} rather than just have 1 serve-all cytochrome. Sadly this is something that was not possible to investigate in this study but could be included in further work onthe subject.
